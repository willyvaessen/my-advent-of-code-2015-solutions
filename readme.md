# My take on Advent of Code 2015

## Introduction

In August of 2022 I started participating in the Bootcamp Full Stack Developer at Novi Hogeschool, in order to learn something new and become a software developer. About two months into the course, we got invitied to participate in the upcoming Advent of Code.
To prepare myself AND to practice, I decided to start working on the very first Advent of Code, being the 2015 edtion.
I'm in no hurry to finish it, instead I want to learn  how to solve the problems we're presented with.

The Advent of Code can be found at https://adventofcode.com/2015

## How I'm approaching the puzzles

Each day in the Advent of Code two puzzles are presented. The second one becomes available as soon as the first part is solved.
I have decided to go for JavaScript, as this is the language we're working on in this part of the course, so it's best known to me.

I create a .js file for eachday and part and a separate file for the input.


## Disclaimer:
I'm fairly new at developing software, despite having worked in IT for many years now. My solution is probably way too large to be anywhere near efficient, but if it's on this repository, it got the job done.
I've been struggling with code that worked just fine, but didn't provide the right solution, mostly because I didn't read the instruction well enough. In some cases I used the information found on https://medium.com/@ghaiklor/advent-of-code-2015-explanation-aa9932db6d6f to point me in the right direction. I wish to say a huge thank you to Eugene Obrezkov for his effort, even though he's probably not even aware he helped me out.
